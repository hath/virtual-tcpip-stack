test case selection strategy
  special values
     instance state
        interval rule on the number of queued entities in the buffers
        (ie none, one and many)
     method parameters
        enqueue_packet_fragment(chunk): split framing over two chunks
                                        incorrect framing
                                           missing $ESC
                                           missing $END

   test cases

      Part A
      ------
      call enqueue_packet and enqueue_packet_fragment and
      check exceptional behaviour

      Part B
      ------
      for each of the special state values and special method parameters
         exercise  method-call sequence represented by Figure 1
         check normal behaviour (ie Line Source input produces  
         the correct Line Sink output)

      Part C
      ------
         Stress test the module methods using AnyEvent
         (normal and exceptional behaviour)

    test implementation strategy
       buildStr (n)  returns a string of 'x' repeated n times
       eg buildStr(4) would return the string 'xxxx'

       statement coverage measured using cover.
